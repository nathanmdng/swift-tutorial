Why learn coding/app development?

A Sense of Self-Reliance and Empowerment
 - After building a website or application – even a simple one – there is always a feeling of accomplishment.

It’s Possible to Make Your Side Project Dreams into Reality
- If you have an amazing idea for a game or app you don't have to wait, you can take action and make it a reality.

A Sense of Freedom
- more opportunities to work remotely, less focus on hours worked and more focus on productivity, more freedom to determine your own schedule.

Games and apps are cool!

"Coders change the world. They build new, amazing things faster than ever before. Anyone with imagination can learn to write code."
– Jeff Wilke SVP Consumer Business, Amazon.com

"Learning to write programs stretches your mind, and helps you think better, creates a way of thinking about things that I think is helpful in all domains."
- Bill Gates Chairman, Microsoft

What makes a good programmer?
- tenacity (patience), when you struggle you will need be anchored to some goal otherwise it's easy to give up
- focus (drive/passion will fuel your tenacity, Bill Gates and Warren Buffet), one thing at a time, one small step at a time, don't get distracted
- humility (hunger to learn, openess to new ideas)

Some goals

Highest Level
- Programming is about breaking things down

- learn from each other on how to build a successful app (popular/revenue-generating/passive income) - I can't teach this yet
- teach you how to write a good app (quality)
- teach you how to think strategically about business,
  - android or iPhone
  - how to prioritize features, e.g. foundation work vs new features, learning to make trade-offs between time, money and quality
  - how to monetize
  - how to go about investing in building the best ideas, POC
- teach you how to write a basic app
- teach you how to code, think of scales when learning piano

Bonus
- would like to assemble a team and to and enter the programming competition
- networking, never know maybe we could help each other out someday... I am working on some cool side-projects with other veterans and might be interested in involving some of you.

Immersion vs Structure
- how do you learn a new language?

Lesson 2

Create a multiple-choice quiz

1. Have a blank MVC load
2. Add a label
3. Add a custom view
4. Introduce a model
